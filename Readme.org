#+TITLE: Godot Camera

** NOTE

This currently does not work as [[https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/46531][CameraServer support is lacking on Android]] :(

** Base

After looking for (and failing to find) a basic camera implementation for Godot I decided to build out this simple example library.

When launched the app opens the camera selector (~CameraSelect.tscn~), and after the user clicks on a chosen camera a new scene is displayed with the users camera input rendered to a viewport.

When the user clicks "Capture" the ~photo_taken~ signal is emitted including the image at that moment from the camera.

** Signals

*** CameraSelect.tscn
- ~camera_selected(camera: CameraFeed)~ is emitted when the user clicks on any camera

*** Camera.tscn
- ~photo_taken(photo: ViewportTexture)~ is emitted when the user clicks on ~capture~ in the camera view
